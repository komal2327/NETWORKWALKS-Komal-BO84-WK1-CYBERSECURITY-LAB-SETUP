```text
                 Host Computer
                       |
                Oracle VirtualBox
                       |
                 Kali Linux VM
                       |
                Virtual Network
                       |
                  NAT Network
                       |
              External Connectivity
```

*Note: External connectivity depends on the actual network configuration, gateway, DNS settings, and applicable firewall rules. The diagram represents the intended setup, not a guarantee that every connection succeeds.*

## ⚙️ Implementation & Verification

### 1. Install and Configure VirtualBox

**Objective:** Establish the virtualization environment.

**Procedure:**
1. Install Oracle VirtualBox on the host machine.
2. Launch VirtualBox and review the VM management interface.
3. Verify that the application opens correctly and is ready to manage virtual machines.

**Verification:** VirtualBox Manager opens successfully.

**Evidence:**

### 2. Import and Configure Kali Linux

**Objective:** Deploy Kali Linux as a guest virtual machine.

**Procedure:**
1. Import the Kali Linux virtual machine or appliance.
2. Review the VM configuration, including memory, processors, storage, and network adapter.
3. Start the virtual machine and confirm that Kali Linux boots successfully.

**Verification:** The guest operating system starts and its desktop or terminal is accessible.

**Evidence:**

### 3. Create a Private NAT Network

**Objective:** Establish a dedicated virtual network for the lab.

**Procedure:**
1. Open VirtualBox's network management settings.
2. Create a NAT Network with a suitable name and IPv4 subnet.
3. Review the DHCP setting and other network parameters.
4. Attach the Kali Linux VM's network adapter to the newly created NAT Network.
5. Save the configuration.

**Verification:** The NAT Network exists in VirtualBox, and the VM is attached to the intended network.

**Evidence:**

### 4. Configure and Verify Kali Linux Network Settings

**Objective:** Inspect the guest's IP addressing and routing configuration.

Run the following commands inside Kali Linux:

```bash
ip -br addr
ip route
```

**Command purpose:**

- `ip -br addr` displays network interfaces and their assigned addresses in a compact format.
- `ip route` displays the routing table, including the default route when configured.

**Verification checklist:**

- [ ] The expected network interface is present.
- [ ] The interface is active.
- [ ] The IP address matches the intended network configuration.
- [ ] The routing table contains the expected route.

Record any discrepancies and the corrective actions taken.

**Evidence:**

### 5. Test Network Connectivity and DNS Resolution

**Objective:** Verify network reachability and hostname resolution.

Run these tests separately:

**A. Check gateway reachability**

```bash
ping -c 4 <gateway-ip>
```

Replace `<gateway-ip>` with the actual gateway address identified from the lab configuration.

**B. Check external IP connectivity**

```bash
ping -c 4 1.1.1.1
```

This tests reachability to an external IP address, provided the destination and network permit ICMP traffic.

**C. Check DNS resolution**

```bash
getent hosts example.com
```

This checks whether the system can resolve the hostname using its configured name-resolution mechanisms.

**Interpretation:**

| Test | What it helps verify |
|---|---|
| Gateway ping | Reachability to the configured gateway |
| External IP test | External network reachability |
| Hostname lookup | DNS/name-resolution functionality |

A failed ping does not always mean that a destination is unreachable; ICMP traffic may be filtered. Interpret results alongside routing information and other relevant tests.

**Verification results:**

| Test | Actual result | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway reachability | [Record result] | [Pass / Fail / Inconclusive] |
| External IP connectivity | [Record result] | [Pass / Fail / Inconclusive] |
| DNS resolution | [Record result] | [Pass / Fail / Inconclusive] |

**Evidence:**

### 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

**Objective:** Preserve a known working state before conducting future lab activities.

**Procedure:**
1. Complete the initial VM and network configuration.
2. Verify the current system state.
3. Open the VM's snapshot management interface.
4. Create a snapshot with a descriptive name.
5. Confirm that the snapshot appears in the VM's snapshot list.

**Verification:** The saved snapshot is visible in VirtualBox Snapshot Manager.

**Snapshot name:** [Enter the actual snapshot name]

**Evidence:**

![VirtualBox snapshot screenshot placeholder](screenshots/06-vm-snapshot.png)

**Why this matters:** A snapshot provides a convenient recovery point if later configuration changes or experiments affect the VM. It is not a substitute for independent backups.

## 🧪 Overall Results

| Task | Completion evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| VirtualBox installation and configuration | VirtualBox Manager | Completed |
| Kali Linux import and configuration | Running guest VM | Completed |
| Private NAT Network creation | Network settings | Completed |
| Kali network settings verification | Interface and route output | Completed |
| Connectivity and DNS testing | Actual test outputs | Update with results |
| Clean snapshot creation | Snapshot Manager | Completed |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & Problem-Solving

Virtual machine networking depends on several components working together, including the network adapter, IP configuration, routing, NAT Network settings, and DNS configuration.

If connectivity or DNS resolution fails, investigate systematically:

**1. Inspect the interface**

```bash
ip -br addr
```

Check the interface state and assigned IP address.

**2. Inspect routing**

```bash
ip route
```

Verify the expected gateway and default route.

**3. Separate IP connectivity from DNS**

Test the configured gateway, then an external IP address, and finally a hostname lookup. This helps narrow down the affected layer.

**4. Review VirtualBox configuration**

Confirm that the VM is connected to the intended NAT Network and that the network settings match the guest's configuration.

**5. Re-test after making a change**

Record the exact corrective action and repeat the relevant tests to verify the outcome.

### Incident Record

## 📚 Key Learnings

This project strengthened my practical understanding of:

- Virtualization and guest operating system deployment.
- Linux network interfaces and IP addressing.
- Routing and NAT Network configuration.
- Network connectivity and DNS troubleshooting.
- Virtual machine snapshots and recovery planning.
- Technical documentation and evidence-based verification.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Use the environment only for authorized cybersecurity learning and testing.
- Keep intentionally vulnerable systems isolated as appropriate.
- Take snapshots before significant configuration changes.
- Avoid exposing sensitive services or credentials.
- Do not commit passwords, private keys, tokens, or sensitive host information.
- Review screenshots before uploading them to a public repository.
- Do not upload complete VM disk images or large appliance exports unless explicitly required and safe.

## ✅ Conclusion

The project established a foundation for future cybersecurity lab exercises by combining virtualization, Linux networking, connectivity verification, and recovery planning.

The main takeaway is that a reliable lab requires more than deploying a virtual machine: its configuration must be inspected, its connectivity tested, and its baseline documented before more advanced activities begin.
